# Core Defence
Core Defence is one of my personal projects in progress inspired by the Defence Grid tower defence games, created to learn the Unreal engine.

The player is tasked with defending core points around the map by building turrets to kill approaching enemies who will attempt to steal cores from the core points. Each core point has several cores, which enemies will take when they reach the core point, if an enemy reaches an exit with a core, the player will lose a life.
